  Before Ecmascript 6 (ES6) you can define the variables using <code>var</code> <br>
  For example: 
  <code>
      var name = "Ikhsan Fauji"
      var age = 23
      var job = "Software Developer"
  </code>
  but you have to be careful because "var" doesn't support scoped block 
  <br>
  Now in ES6 you can define using var, let and const depends on your needs.
  ES6 is already support scoped block using const and let.
  <code>
      const name = "Ikhsan Fauji"
      let age = 23
      var job = "Software Developer"
  </code>
</pre>

<script>
  // var name = "Ikhsan Fauji"
  // var age = 23
  // var job = "Software Developer"

  // pada Ecmascript 6 (ES6) penulisan variable dibagi menjadi 3
  const name = "Ikhsan Fauji"
  let age = 23
  var job = "Software Developer"

  console.log('Hello my name is '+ name + ' I am '+ age + ' years old and I work as a '+ job)
</script>
